# Dagon - A basic interpreted language for learning purposes
The purpose of this project is to learn more about the Go programming language.

## Why?
The objective is to create an interpreted language easy to use. Also, **Dagon** can be used to prepare students (that
have never wrote a line of code before) for compiled languages like **Java**, **C/C++** or even **Go**.

## Syntaxis
The syntaxis of Dagon will be like **C/C++** or **Java** but it will also be easy to learn and use like **Python**.

### Example of the syntax:
```java
String letters = "Hello World!";
Int number = 1256;
Real pi = 3.14159265358979;

Print(letters, number, pi);
```
