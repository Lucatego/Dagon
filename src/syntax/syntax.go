	|------------------------SYNTAX COMPONENT FOR DAGON------------------------|
		The syntax component is the organ of the interpreted language that will
	rule the posible input.
		This component will not call any other components because it should not
	have any dependencias. If this component fails, the other ones will probably
	do.
